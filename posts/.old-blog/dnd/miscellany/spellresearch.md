# Alternative Rules for Spell Research

It is a truth universally acknowledged that high-level Wizards are cool as hell.

I'm sure a few of you will have seen my rules for [free magic](/blog/magic). For those who haven't, they outline a process through which characters can *attempt* to cast spells which they don't have access to normally. Sometimes this works. Most of the time, things get weird for the characters. 

For me, some of the thrill of playing and running D&D is not knowing how a plan is going to turn out. This style of play isn't for everyone. If you prefer your campaigns a little more deterministic, these rules might not be for you.

Essentially, these rules allow the Wizard to learn to do many of the things that Sorcerers can do innately. It is expensive and difficult.

## How it Works


<div class="block" markdown="1">
When away from adventures, some may wish to engage in **spell research**. This powerful technique allows advanced magic users to gain a deeper understanding of certain aspects of the Weave, and exploit these to increase the potency of their magic.

### Spell Research

During downtime a Wizard of at least 8th level may choose to research spells. They must have access to a (magical) Library for at least 8 hours per day. The procedure is as follows:

1. The player rolls a d20. The spell to be upgraded should be looked up in the table below. Note that the Wizard must have the ability to cast the chosen spell.
    <br><br>
    
    | Roll | Researched Spell |
    |--------|----------|
    | 1-2 | The spell is **Prestidigitation**.
    | 3-5 | The spell is **Fireball**.
    | 6-10 | The spell is **Polymorph** (or **True Polymorph** if the caster has access).
    | 11-19 | The caster can choose the spell from their spell book. It must not be an already-upgraded spell.
| 20 | The caster can choose **any** spell from their spell book.
<br>
2. The Wizard *must* pay the material costs of 1000gp per base level of the researched spell, for research materials. If the caster does not have the funds available, they may pause spell research until they have the money. No other spells can be researched in the mean time.
3. The Wizard researches, 8 hours per day, for 2 full weeks per base level of the researched spell.
4. Once complete, the caster will have access to an enhanced version of the researched spell. See **Spell Enhancements** below to determine how.
5. The new version of the spell is called [Player Name]'s [Enhancement Name] [Spell name]. The spell's base level increases by 1, except for the Effortless enhancement.

### Spell Enhancements

Roll a d20. The enhancement gained is described in the table below.
    <br>
    
| Roll | Name | Spell Enhancement |
|--------|---|----------|
| 1 |Volatile|Casting the spell causes a random Magical Effect to occur[^4]. 
| 2 |Twinned|By casting with a spell slot exactly 1 above base level, the effect occurs twice[^1]. The second casting can be retargeted.
| 3 |Illusory| Any creatures who see the spell cast believe that the spell was **Fireball** centred on them, and act accordingly.
| 4-5 |Innate| The spell no longer requires material, somatic, or verbal components.
| 6  |Vindictive| Saves on the spell have +4 to DC.
| 7 |Unstoppable| Concentration on the spell cannot be interrupted.
| 8 | Permanent | The spell's concentration can be maintained indefinitely.
| 9 |Longevious| The spell's duration is doubled.
| 10 |Malleable| The school of the spell can be decided at will.
| 11 |Adaptive| The damage type(s) of the spell can be decided at will.
| 12 |Portative| Once per day, an allied character within line of sight can cast the spell on their turn. This expends one of your spell slots of the appropriate level.
|13|Protected|The caster is surrounded by an golden shimmer for the casting duration + 1 round. During this time their AC is increased by 6. 
|14|Empowered|The spell acts as if cast with a spell slot 2 levels higher.
| 15-16 |Quickened| The spell's casting time reduces by half. If it was an Action, it is now a Bonus Action.
| 17-18 |Distant| The spell's range increases. See the **Range Increase** table below[^2].
| 19 |Painless| When cast, the spell expends a spell slot 2 levels below the chosen slot level instead, if one exists[^3].
| 20 |Effortless| The spell's base level reduces by 1 instead. If it is already 2 or below, it becomes a cantrip.
<br>

 If the effect gained is inapplicable, roll again.

| Roll(d4) | Range Increase |
|---|---| 
| 1 | The range increases by 50%.
| 2 |  The range doubles.
| 3 | The range triples.
| 4 | The range increases to one mile. If it is already at least one mile, it increases to the nearest power of 10 miles.

##Example

Here's an example of how this'll work in practice.

1. Taako, our intrepid Wizard, decides they want to research a spell during downtime.
2. They throw a d20 to decide the spell to research roll a 5 - their spell is *Fireball*.
3. They pay the cost of 1000gp * 3 = 3000gp, and spend 6 weeks researching.
4. They roll a 17 for enhancement. They then roll a 3 on range. This increases the range of their Fireball spell to 150ft*3 = 450ft.
5. The new spell, *Taako's Distant Fireball*, is added to their spell book.

##A note on naming

Side note: If the spell is already named, for example *Mordenkainen's Magnificent Mansion*, the pre-names are removed and the spell is named as if it were originally called *Mansion*. Likewise if the spell is *Create Water* or something similar, it can be renamed to, for example, *Taako's Effortless Water*.

Let me know what you think of these variant rules. And if you consider adding them to your own downtime ruleset, let me know!


[^1]: This uses the BASE version of the spell . Bonuses (damage,range) for using higher-level spell slots are not gained.
[^2]: This includes spells whose usual range is "touch" or "self" - they are considered 10m for the purposes of this calculation.
[^3]: The caster must have a level N spell slot available, but an N-2 spell slot is expended. If the spell is cast with a level 2 slot or lower, it does not expend a spell slot.
[^4]: I recommend the [NLRME](https://centralia.aquest.com/downloads/NLRMEv2.pdf), but you can also use the canonical [Wild Magical Surge table](https://www.geeknative.com/47099/dd-5e-wild-magic/).
