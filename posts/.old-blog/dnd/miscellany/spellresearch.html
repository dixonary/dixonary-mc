<h1>Alternative Rules for Spell Research</h1>
<p>It is a truth universally acknowledged that high-level Wizards are cool as hell.</p>
<p>I'm sure a few of you will have seen my rules for <a href="/blog/magic">free magic</a>. For those who haven't, they outline a process through which characters can <em>attempt</em> to cast spells which they don't have access to normally. Sometimes this works. Most of the time, things get weird for the characters.</p>
<p>For me, some of the thrill of playing and running D&amp;D is not knowing how a plan is going to turn out. This style of play isn't for everyone. If you prefer your campaigns a little more deterministic, these rules might not be for you.</p>
<p>Essentially, these rules allow the Wizard to learn to do many of the things that Sorcerers can do innately. It is expensive and difficult.</p>

<h2>How it Works</h2>
<div class="block">
<p>When away from adventures, some may wish to engage in <strong>spell research</strong>. This powerful technique allows advanced magic users to gain a deeper understanding of certain aspects of the Weave, and exploit these to increase the potency of their magic.</p>
<h3>Spell Research</h3>
<p>During downtime a Wizard of at least 8th level may choose to research spells. They must have access to a (magical) Library for at least 8 hours per day. The procedure is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The player rolls a d20. The spell to be upgraded should be looked up in the table below. Note that the Wizard must have the ability to cast the chosen spell. <br><br></p>
<table style="width:28%;">

</table>
<br></li>
<li>The Wizard <em>must</em> pay the material costs of 1000gp per base level of the researched spell, for research materials. If the caster does not have the funds available, they may pause spell research until they have the money. No other spells can be researched in the mean time.</li>
<li>The Wizard researches, 8 hours per day, for 2 full weeks per base level of the researched spell.</li>
<li>Once complete, the caster will have access to an enhanced version of the researched spell. See <strong>Spell Enhancements</strong> below to determine how.</li>
<li><p>The new version of the spell is called [Player Name]'s [Enhancement Name] [Spell name]. The spell's base level increases by 1, except for the Effortless enhancement.</p></li>

<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Here's an example of how this'll work in practice.</p>
<ol>
<li>Taako, our intrepid Wizard, decides they want to research a spell during downtime.</li>
<li>They throw a d20 to decide the spell to research roll a 5 - their spell is <em>Fireball</em>.</li>
<li>They pay the cost of 1000gp * 3 = 3000gp, and spend 6 weeks researching.</li>
<li>They roll a 17 for enhancement. They then roll a 3 on range. This increases the range of their Fireball spell to 150ft*3 = 450ft.</li>
<li>The new spell, <em>Taako's Distant Fireball</em>, is added to their spell book.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>A note on naming</h2>
<p>Side note: If the spell is already named, for example <em>Mordenkainen's Magnificent Mansion</em>, the pre-names are removed and the spell is named as if it were originally called <em>Mansion</em>. Likewise if the spell is <em>Create Water</em> or something similar, it can be renamed to, for example, <em>Taako's Effortless Water</em>.</p>
<hr />
<p>Let me know what you think of these variant rules. And if you consider adding them to your own downtime ruleset, let me know!</p>
