#Freeing The Magic
###or; how to lose a party to a gang of rampaging sweet rolls

> The door is locked. There is no other way in, and there is no way out. Our intrepid Warlock places her hand over the wrought-iron keyhole and bows her head in concentration. She conceives of the tumblers, the pins. Where they are, and where they ought to be.<br><br>There is a click.

Here is something I am trying out in our campaign to spice things up a bit.
The decisions made here are motivated by a couple of things:

1. 5th Edition as written seems to have a pretty dim view of magic users. Neither the *Wizard* class portion of the *Players' Handbook*, nor the entire section on *Spells*, even mention the concept of spell creation. Designing custom spells is mentioned in the *Dungeon Masters' Guide*, but only from a DM's perspective[^for]. In general spellcasters aren't even allowed to try causing magical effects unless they have found out the entire process from someone else and practised to a fine art. By contrast the 3.5e *Players' Handbook* had an entire section on how players would go about creating spells from nothing (though the rules were [demanding](http://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/3515/rules-for-creating-new-spells)).

1. Our campaign is very story-driven and not beholden to things like *"balance"* and *"mechanics"*. None of us are optimal players, nor are we trying to win. We want to see cool stuff happen.

1. The lines between schools are clear. The lines between *classes* are anything but. Given that some classes can just pick and choose whichever spells they like, and pretty much every spell can be found written down on a scroll, there seems to be no strong  lore reasons for the spell lists as written.[^arcane]

1. The [Wild Mage](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Wild_Mage_(5e_Archetype)) archetype is AWESOME.

As a result, we are playing with a body of rules which basically boil down to one single idea:

<center markdown="1" style="padding:1em 2em; margin:1em 2em;">**Anybody** can attempt to cast **any** spell.</center>

### how it works
<a name="howitworks"></a>

<div class="block" markdown="1">
A character may, at any time, attempt to cast any spell, which they do not currently have prepared and which they do not currently have a sufficient spell slot for. If so, they invoke the Free Magic rules as described below.

<center markdown="1">**Free Magic**</center>

The caster declares the level of spell slot which they are intending to use[^cantrips]. The spell slot is expended[^noslot]. The caster should make a check with their spellcasting ability against the Free Magic DC (as determined below). On a successful cast, the spell is produced as normal. Otherwise the spell goes **wrong**. 

<center markdown="1">**Difficulty Class**</center>
The DC for a Free Magic check is determined as follows:

1. The base DC is 14.
2. The DC increases by +4 for every level above the chosen slot's level.
3. The DC is reduced by the **maximum** amount allowed by the table below, representing the caster's experience with the spell.
4. If the spell is NOT on the class's own spell list, the DC increases by +2.
5. Add any additional modifiers as are situationally relevant (see [here](#guidelines)).

Experience | Modifier
------------- | -------------
- | DC
The caster has **seen** the spell cast. | DC - 2
The caster has **cast** the spell. | DC - 3
The caster has **prepared[^known]** the spell. | DC - 4
The caster has **prepared and cast** the spell. | DC - 5

Example
: A Warlock tries to cast ***Knock*** (a 2nd-level Transmutation) as a Cantrip. She has seen the spell cast before but never tried or prepared it. <br>The DC is 14 + 4*2 [from level differential] - 2 [from experience] + 2 [not a native Warlock spell] = **22**.

<p></p>

Example
: A Bard learned about the spell ***Detect Thoughts*** (2nd-level Divination) but has never seen or cast it. They only have a first-level slot remaining, which is expended by the casting.<br>
The DC is 14 + 4 [level differential] = **18**.

<br><center markdown="1">**Failure**</center>

Failing on a Free Magic check means that the caster has attempted to directly modify the Weave of Magic, and has *not* done it well. Roll on the Wild Surge table[^surge]. The caster must then succeed on a DC10 spellcasting saving throw. 

Saving Throw | Consequence
-----------------|----------------
Success | Take d6 psychic damage. 
Failure | Roll on the Short-Term Madness table[^mad]. 
Critical Failure | Roll on the Long-Term Madness table instead.
<br>

<center markdown="1">**Material Cost**</center>

If the caster is trying to cast a spell which has a material cost, but does not *have* the materials to lose, the result is undefined. Perhaps all their valuable posessions are lost to the Weave[^done]. Maybe the spell just refuses to be cast outright (automatic failure). Be creative.<br><br>

<center markdown="1">**Casting Time**</center>

Some spell effects traditionally have a very long casting time. For example, ***Simulacrum*** has a casting time of 12 hours.
 Free Magics are cast as an action by default. It's at the DMs discretion to ask how long the caster is concentrating for. If the caster concentrates for as long as the spell normally takes to cast, there is no additional penalty. If the casting fails, the failure is noticed by the caster about halfway through the casting time. Trying to cast a "long-cast" spell as an action with Free Magic may have undefined effects, but will probably result in a weaker or *different* version of the intended spell effect.<br><br>

<center markdown="1">**Some additional notes on Free Magic**</center>

1. Attempting to control raw magic requires a working knowledge of how to create a spell effect. A character attempting to use Free Magic must have the ability to cast one spell outside of these rules.
1. Free Magic checks **can** benefit from both Inspiration and Bardic Inspiration.
1. Free Magic checks **cannot** be given Advantage or Disadvantage.
1. The DC is **not** reduced by 4 per level if you use a higher-level slot to cast a spell; though a successful cast may operate at a higher power level as determined by the spell's text.
1. If the chosen slot's level is below the spell's minimum level, a successful cast is at the minimum level.
1. If you know the spell (and have it prepared, for classes which prepare spells), you can only cast it as a Free Magic if you have no remaining spell slots of at least the spell's minimum level.
1. A Natural 1 is an automatic failure. A Natural 20 is **not** an automatic success.
1. Proficiency bonus is not generally added to the roll (but ability modifier is).

###let's go wild

The Wild Magic Surge table is great and all, but there's something ever so slightly more *fun*. That thing is the [Net Libram of Random Magical Effects](http://centralia.aquest.com/downloads/NLRMEv2.pdf). It is a 10,000-element list of possible Wild Magic Surges. Most of them are more benign or unnoticeable than those found in the original WMS table. However, the number of possibilities is just so staggeringly *huge* that if the party cannot work out what's happened straight away, there's a possibility that they never actually will[^until]. For us this is far more interesting. However there is a chance that the entire party explodes, or someone becomes Level 20 or Level 1, every single time someone fails a Free Magic check. Make sure your party is up for it before you try this out!

###more what you'd call guidelines
![](/images/guidelines.gif){.half}

Most importantly of all, this type of magic doesn't work without **strong** DM participation. The powers afforded by Free Magic are many. It is far, far too easy to abuse. The DM has to role-play as something which is inherently fickle and near-impossible to harness. In other words, something un-mechanical; something which *defies mechanics*. Here are some examples of how the DM can improve the experience of Free Magic.

Example
: A Warlock tries to cast ***Prayer of Healing***. The DM warns the Warlock that, as an unholy character, the DC for casting ***Prayer of Healing*** will be increased (but does not say how much). They increase the DC by 5.

Example
: A Paladin, in a desperate attempt to save an ally from an oncoming blast of dragonfire, calls on all of their magic. The DM decides that this constitutes a casting of ***Protection from Energy*** (3rd Level Abjuration) cast remotely rather than in touch range[^diff]. As this is a selfless and good act in line with the Paladin's holy beliefs, the DM silently reduces the DC by 1.

In the words of the Players' Handbook[^quot], which is normally pretty quiet on these matters:

> The worlds within the D&D multiverse are magical places.
All existence is suffused with magical power, and potential
energy lies untapped in every rock, stream, and living
creature, and even in the air itself. Raw magic is the stuff of
creation, the mute and mindless will of existence, permeating
every bit of matter and present in every manifestation of
energy throughout the multiverse.

Well put. I hope you enjoy Free Magic, because we sure are.


[^for]: Which, to be fair, is what it is for.
[^quot]: PHB, p.205 *The Weave of Magic*.
[^arcane]: Not strictly true. There is a clear difference between *arcane* magicks, those employed by Warlocks, Wizards, Bards and the like, and *divine* magicks which are the domains of eg. druids, clerics and paladins. The former group manipulate the Weave of Magic directly, while the latter group get the Gods to do it for them. The PHB covers this on page 205.
[^cantrips]: This may include 0th-level "cantrip" slots.
[^known]: For classes which do not "prepare" spells, ask whether the spell has ever been "known" by the caster.
[^surge]: PHB, p.104 *Wild Magic Surge*.
[^diff]: Note that because only the *effect* is specified and not the exact *spell*, it is not confined by the exact wordings as specified in the spell text. The DM need not reveal which spell was actually cast, or whether there was a corresponding spell at all.
[^mad]:[https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Madness](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Madness)
[^done]: Done this one.
[^until]: Until they come across the next river on their journey, which is running with blood instead of water.
[^noslot]: Casting a Free Magic as a Cantrip doesn't expend any slots.
